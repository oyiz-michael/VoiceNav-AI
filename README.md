VoiceNav‑AI (DevPost Hackathon)

VoiceNav‑AI is a serverless accessibility tool that lets visually‑impaired users navigate modern websites by voice.  An AWS‑Lambda backend converts speech to structured intents (using Amazon Transcribe + a Gen‑AI model) and returns click instructions to the client, which then moves the cursor and reads key page content aloud.
